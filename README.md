# Elevation-Descent

__Elevation-Descent__
---

*Project Overview:
  The objective of this project is to use digital terrain elevation data and developed algorithms to build a more accurate, mathematically validated grading systems for runs at ski resorts. Then, collect data using sensors and skiers to validate and improve the results from the remote data.

*Project Goals:
  1. Semester:
    Develop python code capable of analyzing a path along a data-point matrix of elevation values and determining a difficulty grade for that path. Then, use this python utility to evaluate the runs at two different ski resorts in order to compare and contrast their grading scales. Next, use skiers and sensors to collect elevation data and use this to validate/improve the code. Lastly, prepare a presentation  that introduces and outlines the new and improved grading scale and how it was developed. Use a comparison of the two ski resorts analyzed to illustrate the new system.

  2. Moonshot:
    a. Name the new grading scale and have it become the international standard for ski runs.
    b. Develop a smartphone application that allows users to draw their own runs on a map of a ski resort, then displays the run's difficulty. The app could then guide them through the route, allow them to name their route, post lap times and other information, then share it with other users.
    c. Sell the code to a manufacturer such as Oakley to be embedded into augmented reality goggles that guide a user through ski runs and provide visual difficulty feedback.

*Where to start if you are interested in contributing:
  -Become familiar with the current stage of the project
  -Set up a coding environment for coding in python
  -Become familiar with elevation data such as SRTM 30M (1 arc-second)
  -A familiarity with gradient descent and other mathematical slope-related tools may be helpful as well.
